                                                            While most homes use a combination of floor coverings including ceramic tile, natural stone, concrete, vinyl and wood, carpet remains a significant favorite. There is a good reason for this vast use of this textile. Carpeted floors provide warmth, physical comfort, noise control and a great appearance. They can even improve indoor air quality – studies show that carpet can act as a trap or filter for soils and gases – if it is kept clean. During the pre-inspection process we will be on alert for pets, children, exotic plants, spills, soiling, water damage and preexisting damage to carpets. After cleaning, there will be a thorough post walkthrough to answer any questions that the customer may have.

                                                            In a typical six-room home, up to 40 pounds of dust is created annually through everyday living. Through normal occupation in a home, we generate a great deal of contaminants and air pollutants, such as dander, pathogens, dust and chemicals. Asthma, allergies, and colds are caused from dirty air pollutants. These contaminants are pulled into the HVAC system and re-circulated 5 to 7 times per day, on average.

                                                            Natural stone can be damaged by dirt and other materials that often scratch its surface. It is also damaged by wax, floor finishes and buildup or by using the wrong cleaning chemicals. Foot traffic, acidic cleaners, cola, coffee, fruit juice and wine can dull and etch the stone. Because these products contain citric acids, along with alcohol and other harsh agents, can ultimately damage these beautiful stones permanently. The depth and richness of a high gloss polish finish is achieved by mechanically re-polishing the natural stone.

The problem with grout is that it is a porous material, which collects dirt, grime, and spills that can often discolor the surface. Mopping will not reach the dirt that lies deep within the pores of the grout lines. Our professional tile and grout cleaning restores your floors, making them look like new.

                                                            For older vinyl composite tiles, any build up of floor finish on this type of floor will have to be stripped to remove all old finish and sealers. We like to reseal with an acrylic sealer and finish. We will normally apply two to three coats of sealer followed by three to four coats of finish until desired shine or depending on the age of the floor and the porosity of the tile.

                                                            For New VCT, remove the factory paraffin protective coating placed on by the manufactured, followed by an application of sealer and finish using three coats of sealer and three coats of finish.  After this process is completed, VCT is easy to maintain. We spray buff VCT to give it the wet look year round. Spray buffing is accomplished by dust mopping all floor area then mopping on a special renovator followed by a high RPM machine to burnish the shine into the floor.

That means no messy splashing of baseboards, walls, etc. This process is not only more user friendly, it is environmentally friendly as well.  The machine is made in America and the pads are made of recycled materials and at less than 73 decibels - it is ultra quiet.

                                                            When water loss occurs, the single most critical factor in defining the amount of potential damage is the amount of time the structure remains abnormally wet. It is for this reason, initially, the most critical course of action in restorative drying is responding quickly. Where abnormal moisture is present microorganisms will rapidly multiply and cause structural deterioration, create odors and potentially serious health issues for building occupants. The restorative drying process - assessment, documentation, controlled drying and selective replacement.
